# The Lawn Journal

## Overview

This repository is part of a [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) project that I am using to learn and improve my skills with [Python](https://www.python.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

In addition to helping me improve my skills, I am also documenting the development process on the [Start Writing Code Blog](https://www.startwritingcode.com/).

To follow along and be a part of the process, checkout the [Projects](https://www.startwritingcode.com/projects/) section of the site.

## Project Description

The basic idea of this project is to build a fully functional web application using Python, React, and MongoDB that will allow users to track activities that they perform on their lawn. These activities could range from basic mowing and watering to product applications and beyond.

The site will contain basic authentication and the ability to log in with third parties like Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, etc.

Once users have logged in and created an account, they will be able to track one or many lawns and what they are doing to take care of it. Users will be able to track lawn dimensions as well as upload pictures for tracking before and after progress of what they are trying to accomplish.

## Project Technologies/Languages

The goal is to make this web app a Single Page Application (SPA) with React on the front-end and use Python Flask for the backend API. The Python Flask backend will communicate with a MongoDB database as the primary data repository.
